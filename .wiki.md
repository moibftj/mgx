# Project Summary
The project is a comprehensive Point of Sale (POS) system designed for businesses to manage sales, product distribution, and reporting. It features a dual login system for Admins and Riders, allowing for efficient inventory management and sales processing. The goal is to streamline operations in a retail environment, providing tools for tracking sales, managing stock, and generating reports. The system now includes complete mock data for products, categories, users, transactions, and settings, enhancing its functionality for testing and demonstration purposes.

# Project Module Description
